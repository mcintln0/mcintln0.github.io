<h2> Installing lights in different places is not 
a task that should be taken up without forethought.
<br>These are some of the questions/concerns that
 should be considered when placing lights</h2>

<pre>
<p>
<b>How were the light positions decided?</b>
	<ul><li>The lights at the cross are based on the crests of the hills, and when the road diverges. The location was chosen because the cross is a popular place to visit at Sewanee, but there are no lights on the way to the cross, so at night it is completely dark.</li>
        <li>The other lights are based on places that the Sewanee Community frequently travel that do not currently have lights, or if there is a light, it does not function properly.</li>
Along with:
	<li> Crosswalks with low visibility.
	<li> Residential Areas with areas of no/limited visiblity 
	<li> Paths frequented during the day as well as party weekends where there is not light or a path.


<b>Could lights along the cross pathway affect the wildlife?</b>
	Yes. However, there are ways to reduce the negative impact on wildlife by using orange/yellow tinted lights. Another alternative, would be to place raised pavement markers and re-paint, and re-pave the road because there are a large number of potholes (that are nearly unavoidable when driving at night).
(information about the effects of lights on animals found <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2018/06/let-there-be-light-but-be-mindful-of-the-wildlife/">here</a>)

<b> Is this a comprehence analysis of the lights on campus?</b>
	Absolutely not. However, most of the campus is covered and high traveled locations have been checked and double checked to make sure that malfunctioning lights are identified, and noted properly on the map. Along with any areas that are scary, dangerous for pedastrians, or simply underlit. 

<b> Are lights at Sewaneee a pressing matter or a just another excuse to complain?</b>
	As a someone who has walked around Sewanee at the strangest times in order to finish coding assignments, I can defintely say the issues of lights at Sewanee are underrated and should be a higher concern. As a driver, there are times when the lack of light at a frequently walked turn makes me fear that I will hit someone because of how dark it is.
If I did not think it was important, I would not have spent the time walking around campus to ensure that every area was convered. While before, "wanting lights" was an abstract statement, I hope the use of visuals will allow those who can make a difference to see that lights are important and without them the campus will continue to have a feeling of unsaftey.
