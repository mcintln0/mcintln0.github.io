<h2 style="text-align:center"> A quick summation of this project </h2>
<div style="width:100%; padding-right:50px; background: white">

   <b> What is the scope of this project?</b>
	The project encompasses from the Memorial Cross to Sewanee Inn, Phillips to Trez, and the faculty residential area near the university Farm. This includes but is not limited to all student residential areas, popular outlooks, and fraternity houses.

    <b> How was the information Collected</b>
	The light information on this website was collected by hand using a coordinates app on an ipad,and walking to each location on the map. The paths were auto-generated using a googles directional service, and the questions tab is a hypothesis of potentional problems that could arise depending on where and how lights are installed.

    <b> How were lights labeled Working or "Broken" </b>
	If the light is sensored but didn't turn on after multiple tries,it is catergorized as broken (because if it is not fulfilling its purpose then it is).
	Lights that have been off most of the semester are also designated as broken.

    <b> Choosing Locations </b>
	Locations were indicated based on saftey concerns regarding areas without light corridors, for example:
		Any place where going there is not optional
			Dorms
			Entrances and Exits of Academic Buildings
			Near Dumpsters
			Sidewalks
			Crosswalks 
		Places of heavy foot traffic
		Areas outside the scope of the <a href="LightPosts.pdf">current lights</a>

    <b> Pricing </b>
	The prices for light installation are generally around $6000 per light pole, but significantly lower for other types of lights. This is why there are different types of lights suggested depending on the location. For example, between fraternities, the lights suggested are smaller, akin to a garden pathway. While some suggestions are of the black lamp posts already placed around campus, but in areas that currently have no light.
